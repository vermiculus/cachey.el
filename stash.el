;;; Commentary:

;; stash.el provides lightweight, persistent caching of Lisp data.  It
;; enables the programmer to create variables which will be written to
;; disk after a certain amount of idle time, as to not cause
;; unnecessary blocks to execution.

;;; Code:
(eval-when-compile
  (require 'cl-lib))

(defgroup stash nil
  "Customization group for stash."
  :prefix "stash-"
  :group emacs)

(defcustom stash-directory (locate-user-emacs-file "stash")
  "Directory where stash variable files are saved."
  :type 'directory
  :group 'stash)

(defun stash-new (variable file &optional default-value write-delay)
  "Define VARIABLE as a new stash to be written to FILE.
VARIABLE's default value will be DEFAULT-VALUE.  When set, it
will automatically be written to disk after Emacs is idle for
WRITE-DELAY seconds."
  (put variable 'stash-file file)
  (put variable 'stash-default-value default-value)
  (put variable 'stash-write-delay write-delay)
  (stash-set variable default-value))

(defun stash-set (variable value &optional immediate-write)
  "Set VARIABLE to VALUE.
If IMMEDIATE-WRITE is non-nil, VARIABLE's data is written to disk
immediately."
  (set variable value)
  (let ((delay (get variable 'stash-write-delay)))
    (if (and delay (not immediate-write))
        (run-with-idle-timer delay nil #'stash-save variable)
      (stash-save variable)))
  (stash-get variable))

  "Return VARIABLE's data."

(defun stash-reset (variable)
  "Reset VARIABLE to its initial value."
  (stash-set variable (get variable 'stash-default-value)))

(defun stash-read (variable-or-file &optional default)
  "Return value stashed for VARIABLE-OR-FILE.
If VARIABLE-OR-FILE is a symbol, use its 'stash-file property.  If
file doesn't exist, return DEFAULT."

          (insert-file-contents file)
          (goto-char (point-min))
          (read (current-buffer)))

  "Define SYMBOL as a stash variable, and return SYMBOL.
Similar to `defvar' except the variable is also saved to disk in
a file inside `stash-directory' (the stash).  DEFAULT-VALUE is
only used if the stash didn't already exist.  If it did, the
variable's initial value is taken from there.

In order to ensure the stash is up-to-date, the variable's value
should be changed with `stash-set' or `stash-setq' instead of
`set' or `setq'.

DOCSTRING is passed to `defvar'.

In addition, this macro also takes the following keyword
arguments:
:subdir
    a subdirectory, inside `stash-directory', in which to save
    the stash.
:filename
    a name for the stash.  If this is absent, a sanitized version
    of SYMBOL is used.
:delay
    the amount of idle time, in seconds, before the stash is
    updated after the value has been changed (default 5)."
